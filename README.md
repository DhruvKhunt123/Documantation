# GROUP- B

 
# Surround the operators by spaces.
     Ex. when we use Binary operator
    a = (b + c) * d;  
    And not as:   
    a=(b+c)*d 

# Use storeProcedure instead of queries.


# Select requried columns only 
     do not write select * from table all time

# Classes name start with capital letter and function name start with small letter.
   All the constants should be in capital letters.

 
# Avoid making Useless objects and variables as it occupies more memory.

 
# Follow MVC pattern as it seperates UI from business logic.

 
# Define datatype as requried like int16,int32,int64,bigint,varchar(32),nvarchar(64),

# Your code should be understandable by others , thus use proper comments where-ever required, use meaning full variables.

 
# Make sure that you Commit after modifying/testing your code

# Your project should follow perticular model.
    Ex. 1-Waterfall model, 2- Agile model
